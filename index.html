        dog, (Canis lupus familiaris), domestic mammal of the family Canidae
        (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and
        is related to foxes and jackals. The dog is one of the two most
        ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world (the cat is
        the other). For more than 12,000 years it has lived with humans as a
        hunting companion, protector, object of scorn or adoration, and friend.
        The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds.
        Human beings have played a major role in creating dogs that fulfill
        distinct societal needs. Through the most rudimentary form of genetic
        engineering, dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident
        from their earliest encounters with humans. Although details about the
        evolution of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs were hunters with keen
        senses of sight and smell. Humans developed these instincts and created
        new breeds as need or desire arose.

        Once it became evident that dogs were faster and stronger and could see
        and hear better than humans, those specimens exhibiting these qualities
        were interbred to enhance such attributes. Fleet-footed sight hounds
        were revered by noblemen in the Middle East, while in Europe powerful
        dogs such as the mastiff were developed to protect home and traveler
        from harm. As society changed and agriculture—in addition to
        hunting—became a means of sustaining life, other breeds of dogs were
        developed. Herding and guarding dogs were important to farmers for
        protecting their flocks. At the same time, small breeds became desirable
        as playthings and companions for noble families. The Pekingese in China
        and fragile breeds such as the Chihuahua were bred to be lapdogs. The
        terrier breeds were developed, mainly in England, to rid granaries and
        barns of rodents. Pointing and retrieving breeds were selected for
        special tasks related to aiding the hunter to find and capture game.
        Many breeds are extremely ancient, while others have been developed as
        recently as the 1800s.
